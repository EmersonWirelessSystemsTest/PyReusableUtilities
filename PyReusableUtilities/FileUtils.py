    """
    Acquires a lock on a file (through a <filepath>.lock file) before yielding control back to the program.
    This ensures multiple threads, processes, or programs trying to access the same file do not encounter a race condition.

    This function MUST be called as a context manager (using the "with" keyword) to ensure setup and cleanup are done correctly.
    No object is returned by the context manager.

    Args:
        filepath: The path to the file for which a lock is to be acquired.
        timeout_sec: An optional timeout (in seconds) of how long to wait for the file to avoid getting stuck.

        TimeoutError: If the lock cannot be acquired within timeout_sec seconds, a TimeoutError will be raised.
